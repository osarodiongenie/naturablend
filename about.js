              <p>
                Sunspel produced some of the world's earliest T-shirts. In the
                late 1800s the business made luxury tunics and undershirts from
                lightweight Sea Island cotton for export to the Far East and
                other warm climates. While these garments initially had silk
                buttoned plackets, these were removed in the early 1900s and
                replaced with simple bound necks to reduce manufacturing costs -
                creating the T-shirt. We've supplied the world as the T-shirt
                has evolved from underwear to outerwear, from symbol of youthful
                rebellion to everyday wardrobe staple, and we've spent decades
                refining its every last aspect.

                Our founder, Thomas Hill, had both an eye for quality and a
                desire to innovate. As well as using the finest fibres such as
                Sea Island cotton, cashmere and silk, he invented his own
                fabrics. Sunspel continues this commitment to innovation today
                and our unique fabrics include: Q100 Sea Island cotton, Q82
                Supima cotton, Q75 warp knit mesh cotton and Q14 warp knit
                cellular cotton. The technology behind these fabrics remains
                unchanged today and all Sunspel products use the finest cottons,
                wools and fibres.
